Single Responsibility
# A class should only be responsible for one thing.
# 


Open/Closed Principle
# An entity should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
# e.g. open source package where we can add function but don't modifiy core functionality.

Liskov Substitution Principle
# works for derived classes
# same interface of class gives same result
# class RubberDuck extends Duck
